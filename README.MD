# Binary log Sync

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use binary logs for syncing databases, particularly in scenarios where the process of dumping and loading data can be time-consuming. The use case simulated here is the migration of databases from Amazon RDS to a self-hosted MySQL instance. 

During the migration, while the initial data is being dumped and loaded into the self-hosted MySQL, new data continues to be added to the RDS database. This project shows how to leverage binary logs to sync the databases efficiently, ensuring that no data is lost or missed during the transition.

## Project Components

- **YouTube Demo**: A video demonstration of the entire process is available on YouTube. The video covers the complete workflow from data dumping to syncing using binary logs.

- **Scripts**: The repository includes scripts that automate the migration and synchronization process. These scripts are crucial for handling the complexities of data syncing, especially when dealing with ongoing data writes during migration.

## Workflow

### 1. Data Dumping
- The first step in the migration process is to dump the existing data from the Amazon RDS database.
- A full backup of the database is created and exported to a file that will later be used to populate the self-hosted MySQL instance.

### 2. Data Loading
- The dumped data is then loaded into the self-hosted MySQL database.
- This process might take significant time, especially for large databases, during which new data continues to be added to the RDS instance.

### 3. Leveraging Binary Logs
- To ensure that no new data is missed during the migration, binary logs from the RDS database are utilized.
- Binary logs capture all the changes made to the database after the initial dump.
- These logs are continuously applied to the self-hosted MySQL database, syncing it with the RDS database in real-time.

### 4. Final Sync
- Once the data loading process is complete, the binary logs are used to perform a final sync, ensuring that the self-hosted database is up-to-date with all changes made in the RDS database since the dump.

## How to Use

1. **Watch the Video Demo**:
   - Start by watching the YouTube demo to understand the entire process visually.

2. **Run the Scripts**:
   - Use the provided scripts to automate the migration and syncing process.
   - Ensure you have the necessary access to the Amazon RDS instance and the self-hosted MySQL server.

3. **Dump and Load Data**:
   - Execute the data dump from the RDS instance using the provided script.
   - Load the dumped data into the self-hosted MySQL database.

4. **Apply Binary Logs**:
   - Run the script to apply the binary logs from the RDS instance to the self-hosted database.
   - Monitor the process to ensure that all data changes are synced properly.

5. **Perform Final Sync**:
   - After the initial data load is complete, perform a final sync using the binary logs to ensure that the self-hosted MySQL database is fully up-to-date.

## Notes

- Make sure to configure your scripts with the correct database credentials and paths.
- Monitor the syncing process closely, especially during the final sync, to ensure data integrity.
- The scripts and video demo are designed to provide a clear understanding of how to manage data migrations with minimal downtime using binary logs.

This project showcases an effective method for database migration, minimizing downtime and ensuring data consistency through the use of binary logs.
